<h3>About Me In 10 Fun Facts</h3>
<p>
1. I'm from Missouri. My parents house is actually 20 minutes from the Far West, Missouri Temple site!<br>
2. My favorite ice cream is chocolate brownie. I love adding mini marshmellows to it. <br>
3. I love to accompany on the piano. I played the organ in my home ward. <br>
4. My first ever exposure to programming was CS124. <br>
5. My husband and I are expecting a little baby boy in June! We haven't decided on a name yet. <br>
6. I don't love hiking, but I love taking super long walks. (The difference is...elevation!) <br> 
7. A weird trick I can do is fit my whole fist in my mouth. <br>
8. Glitter pens are my go to office supply. I use them every. single. day. <br>
9. My favorite board game is monopoly. No one ever wants to play it though!<br>
10. I did web dev for my internship, but I still don't really know what I'm doing :) <br>
